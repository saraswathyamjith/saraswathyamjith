## Research

### In-Context Learning for Esoteric Programming Languages: Evaluating and Enhancing LLM Reasoning Without Fine-Tuning
• Researching the application of LLMs for programming in esoteric languages, focusing on their ability to reason and adapt beyond their training data. <br>
• Evaluating a novel in-context reinforcement learning approach to enhance large language models performance on highly specialized tasks without costly overhead of retraining data.

### Illegal Logging Remote Sensing Detection
• Developed a novel machine learning approach combining radar and satellite imagery to detect selective logging in tropical forests. <br>
• This project earned me a finalist position in the 2024 Regeneron Science Talent Search, recongition as the nation's top 40 young scientists. 

## Projects
### 👗 Fittd.
• Created **Fittd.**, a social fashion-sharing app that allows users to post and browse daily outfit of the day's (OOTD's) !. The app is available on the App Store.
